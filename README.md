# Anki Add-on: Export Known Words to Clipboard

A simple add-on to export known words (and sentences) from mature Anki cards to your clipboard for easy pasting into other applications like Migaku, spreadsheets, or text editors.

## Note on Direction Change

This add-on was originally designed to sync directly to Migaku, but was changed to a clipboard export approach due to the complexity of browser automation and lack of a public Migaku API. This approach is more reliable, works with any application, and doesn't require external dependencies.

## Features

- **Export mature cards**: Only exports cards with intervals of 21+ days (mature cards)
- **Flexible export options**: Choose between words only or words with sentences
- **Custom field mapping**: Select which fields contain your words and sentences
- **Clipboard export**: Copies formatted text directly to your clipboard
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **No dependencies**: Uses only built-in Anki libraries
